It was a fun project for research purposes only. Feel free to work this code into your own
projects or change it in any way you see fit.

Some features are mostly useless in the scope of this project but I wanted to experiment with different methods for future
projects.

Getting started:

Run main.py to set up a new user or spin up the server

python main.py

...follow instructions...

Run stub.sh to create the stub executable (needs pyinstaller - pip install pyinstaller)

bash stub.sh

...enter required settings...

The stub is created in the dist directory

Working on adding a multithreaded socket server and better user interface for both server and client functions

Also looking to improve the usability and functionality of the stub.py

Working towards adding all the tools visible on the help page
